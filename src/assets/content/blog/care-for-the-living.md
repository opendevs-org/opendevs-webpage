hi everyone, 👋
at [opendevs](https://opendevs.in) our goal is to help fellow people. india recently went through a pretty rough period with it's medical infrastructure being overburdened & people not getting the care that they should get. but we saw people definitely wanted to help others & there were communications but they were all scattered. to make a single place where people in need & people who can help can come together we created a platform where people can request for any sort of donations whether it be plasma, oxygen, medicine, blood, monetary or any other & if anyone has something the other needs, they can help them out. this portal has already been helped with many requests & it's continuing to do so.
