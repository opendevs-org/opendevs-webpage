hi everyone, 👋
today we’ll have a look at great tool that enables us to download aws s3 data smartly. 👨‍💻

## so what is this tool?

this project enables downloading data from s3 a breeze, it has 3 modes _(CLI mode, Interactive mode & Download All mode)_ using which you can download _aws s3 bucket_ files into default or custom path.<br/>
If you choose the same directory as previous time, it'll `sync` those changes.

> It now supports setting of aws config like AWS Access key ID, AWS Secret key, AWS region & Output format in interactive mode

### 🏠 [homepage](https://github.com/open-devs/S3-Bucket-Download/#README)

### ✨ [npm link](https://www.npmjs.com/package/s3-bucket-downloader)

## install

```sh
npm i -g s3-bucket-downloader
```

## usage

_run anyone of following commands (only interactive mode available currently):_

> interactive mode now supports setting of aws config like AWS **access key ID**, **secret key**, **region** & **output format** in interactive mode if none present in the system.

```sh
s3
# or
s3-downloader
# or
s3-bucket-downloader
```

## usage (advanced user)

> advanced users have to set AWS config themselves for now

### _interactive mode:_

```sh
node download
```

> it'll display list of all buckets in an array & ask for options like:

### _CLI mode:_

```sh
node download --bucketName=[comma,seperated,bucketnames] --path=[path to save to for ex: ../data]
```

> without brackets ofcourse.

### _download all mode:_

```sh
node download --all
```

> just downloads all of the files in all of the buckets.

## logs:
